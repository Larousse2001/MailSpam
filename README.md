# Spam Email Detection

This project is a machine learning application that predicts whether an email is spam or not. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms and techniques to analyze email content and classify it as either spam or legitimate. The machine learning model is trained on a dataset consisting of labeled emails, where each email is associated with a spam or non-spam label.

## Features

- Email Preprocessing: The project preprocesses the email data by removing stop words, performing stemming, and converting text to numerical representations.
- Feature Extraction: Various features are extracted from the email content, such as word frequency, presence of specific keywords, and email metadata.
- Model Training: The machine learning model is trained using a labeled dataset, applying algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, or support vector machines.
- Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Email Classification: The trained model is used to classify new emails as spam or non-spam based on their content and features.
- User Interface: A user-friendly interface allows users to enter an email and receive a prediction on whether it is spam or not.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-email-detection.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd spam-email-detection`.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Download the email dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NNorN4AuMSS7-UySUGtEecDoFBE-VNVb/view?usp=share_link) and place it in the project's data directory.
5. Modify the configuration files or scripts to adjust any necessary settings or paths.
6. Run the project using `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`.
7. Access the application through the provided user interface or API endpoints.

## Usage

1. Start the application or run the prediction script.
2. Enter an email into the user interface or provide it via the API endpoint.
3. The machine learning model will process the email and predict whether it is spam or not.
4. The application will display the prediction or provide the output through the API response.
